<h3> Homework 8: Ethical Reasoning Paper </h3>

<div class="description">

<h2 id="due-mon-12-4"><strong>Due  Mon 12/4</strong></h2>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>For this assignment, you will write a short (2 to 3 page) paper applying two different forms of ethical reasoning to an ethical dilemma related to the field of Software Engineering (and Computer Science more broadly). This will give you an opportunity to dig more deeply into a software-related social issue, and to practice using effective written communication in regards to technical systems.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Practice applying ethical reasoning to the development of software systems</li>
<li>Consider multiple systems for making ethical decisions</li>
<li>Practice with persuasive writing about technical systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assignment-details">Assignment Details</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will be writing about a single ethical decision (of your choice) posed by an aspect of a software development project. For example, you might consider Facebook&#39;s decision to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/furor-erupts-over-facebook-experiment-on-users-1404085840">utilize social network members as participants in psychological/sociological experiments</a>. You may choose your own situation (e.g., based on the readings from class or your own interests/experience). Note that your situation should be reflect an <strong>actual real-life dilemma related to existing technology</strong>; it will not be a simple case study as in the Brinkman reading. (The situation may be hypothetical, but should be grounded in actual, specific events or entities). Your paper should be explicit about the real-life circumstances that give rise to the dilemma. Name names.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen a situation, you should analyze the situation using <strong>two</strong> different ethical theories. These may be among those discussed in class and described in the readings, for example Virtue Ethics, Utilitarian Ethics (act or rule), and Deontological Ethics. If you are motivated to do so, you may consider the situation from the viewpoint of other ethical theories outside of those we touched on in class, but please be sure to provide adequate references.</p>
<p>You will apply each of the ethical systems you&#39;ve chosen to the situation and determine the ethical course of action, comparing and contrasting the results.</p>
<h2 id="paper-content">Paper Content</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your paper should briefly (in a few sentence) describe the situation to situate the reader--however, do not spend too much time before getting into your analysis!</li>
<li>Be sure and identify the dilemma! Who are the players? What decision is being made, and what conflicting set of motivations make this a dilemma? If any of these questions is hard to answer, your dilemma is probably not specific and concrete enough.</li>
<li>If there is only one &quot;obvious&quot; choice, then it isn&#39;t an ethical decision!</li>
<li>Use ethical reasoning (as described by Brinkman) to determine the best course of action each of your chosen ethical theories in isolation.</li>
<li>Note that ethical reasoning using a particular ethical system may not lead you to a conclusion that you personally deem &quot;correct&quot; (e.g., that matches with your own personal ethical code). That is okay and even expected--the goal is to consider a situation from an alternative point of view.</li>
<li>The two ethical systems may come to either the same or different conclusions on which course of action to take. This is normal---indeed, ethical systems often agree with one another, just with a different basis for the decision!</li>
<li>You should conclude your essay with a short consideration of the distinctions between these systems for your situation. Did they come to different decisions or the same? Are those decisions based on similar or different factors? Would one theory be more &quot;applicable&quot; than another in this situation?</li>
<li>Make sure your paper has a <strong>clear, identifiable thesis statement</strong> early on (ideally in the first paragraph). This statement should sum up the argument of the paper.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>This assignment will be evaluated on the following criteria:</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your paper explains the situation being considered</li>
<li>Your paper identifies the ethical dilemma presented by the situation</li>
<li>Your paper accurately applies two separate ethical theories</li>
<li>You come to a resolution based on sound ethical reasoning</li>
<li>You compare the decision suggested by each theory and evaluate the appropriateness of each</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Writing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your argument is clearly laid out, with ideas flowing logically and effectively from one to the next</li>
<li>Your writing has effective style and cadence, using words and rhetorical devices appropriately</li>
<li>Your paper is free of grammatical errors and shows evidence of proofreading</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your paper shows evidence of thought and effort</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grade-weighting-lateness">Grade weighting &amp; lateness</h2>
<p>This assignment has a weight of 2 within the individual assignments portion of your overall grade. This assignment will be accepted for partial credit up to 4 days late, with a penalty of 20% per day.</p>
